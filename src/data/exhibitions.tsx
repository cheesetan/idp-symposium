    synopsis:
      "This research examines the therapeutic potential of ubiquitin E3 ligase and heat shock proteins (HSP) in addressing CGG repeat-expansion-induced neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is marked by neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra (SN), where neurons controlling movement reside. The degeneration is linked to PolyGlycine (PolyG) chains produced through CGG repeat expansions, which cause neuronal damage. E3 ligase helps degrade misfolded proteins, while HSPs assist in refolding them. Studying their effects may lead to treatments targeting misfolded proteins like PolyG, reducing the rate of neurodegeneration and improving the quality of life for PD patients.",

Two sets of LAMP primers targeting the capsid protein gene of IHHNV strain ZJ-2014-24 (KU373072), were synthesised after evaluation of several sets of primers. The primers were then tested for their ability to accurately detect the presence of IHHNV. In conclusion, primer set Capsid protein (ID: 72) was successful, while primer set Capsid protein (ID: 92) was not.",

Within the built environment, it can be used to carbonate drinks and other applications with low technical requirements. The remaining carbon dioxide can then be stored and transported to more specialised locations with more technical equipment, such as research labs, which allow for the production of more specialised products. Outside the built environment, it can be used in the curing of cement, making the cement blocks less porous and stronger. It can also be used to produce graphene and carbon nano-tubes, along with various commercial applications, such as cooling it down to dry ice, allowing for safer transport of produce over long distances. It can be used in its supercritical form as an organic solvent to decaffeinate coffee.",

During such diseases, TRPM4 (an ion channel) becomes upregulated, leading to an influx of sodium/chloride ions and, thus, cell death. Our research delves into the therapeutic potential of a TRPM4-blocking antibody (M4P) in protecting lung cell integrity; by testing LPS-induced lung inflammation mice models and quantifying the effects of M4P. This research can help better understand the application of M4P in respiratory illnesses, potentially saving many lives in severe respiratory cases.",
